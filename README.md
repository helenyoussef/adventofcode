## day 1
struggled to even think of how to open the file, copied someone else's answer for the first part and did the second part independently

## day 2
completed it independently and was very proud of myself

## day 3 
kept coming up with the wrong answer when using a list so learnt how to use sets and implemented that, finally worked
